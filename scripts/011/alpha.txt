Please, consider the following list of sentences and prepare a complete prompt for developing software with python and streamlit.

1. I want to simulate a simple electric circuit with one voltage source and a voltage divisor implemented with two fixed resistances and one variable resistance.
2. The users can set the values of the voltage source, the fixed resistances and the variable resistance.
3. The simulation must show virtual instruments displaying the value of the circuit current, voltage in each component, and dissipated power.
4. The color of the resistances and wires must change if the dissipated power is too high.
5. The goal of this simulation is to engage a group of teenagers in a game like experience during a visit to an electronic lab in the university,
so the system must be easy to operate and hack.
